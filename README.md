diy mp3 player for kids
![musikkiste](images/musikkiste.jpg =400x)
## Overview
This is a simple diy mp3 player (not only) for kids. Is is based on the DFrobot Mp3 Mini module wich has everything onboard. No programming required. 

Volume adjustments are done with the potentiometer. It is possible to use the buttons on the mp3 Module. I will max the volume after powerloss though.

## Copy Files
The Order in which the files are copied onto the microSD card defines which button they are assigned to. i.e. the first file is Segement 1.
